  This dashboard shows the engagement across all wards in Leeds. It is a work in
  progress that will be extended as more data is aggregated onto this data
  microsite. Bringing this data together in one place will give a quick view of
  areas where further engagement is needed.

  some metrics (e.g. school learners), this is the postcode of the school, not
  the residence postcode.
