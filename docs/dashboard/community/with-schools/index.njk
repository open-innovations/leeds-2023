<p>
  This dashboard shows the engagement across all wards in Leeds. It is a work in
  progress that will be extended as more data is aggregated onto this data
  microsite. Bringing this data together in one place will give a quick view of
  wards where further engagement is needed.

<p class='notification'>
  This version of the dashboard includes schools data. Be aware that this might skew data presented.
  You can also review <a href="/dashboard/community/">a version of the dashboard without schools data</a>.

      The metrics included in the overall hexmap are listed below. The data for each
      can be found in the table below the hexmap. The activity has been allocated to
      ward by mapping the postscodes associated with the activity. In the case of
      some metrics (e.g. school learners), this is the postcode of the school, not
      the residence postcode.
