The LEEDS 2023 team have to periodically create KPI (Key Performance Indicator) reports for our stakeholders,
whether funders, trustees or other interested parties. This project is focussed on automating the process of
creating and presenting these reports, ideally with no manual processing.

These reports will be in a similar style to [Open Innovationsâ€™ sponsor reviews][OI_REVIEW], presenting the key
metrics and narrative that are important to each stakeholder. 

[OI_REVIEW]: https://open-innovations.org/services/sponsors/reports/2021/

We will start with Leeds City Council, the KPIs for which are as follows: 

* Create job opportunities for at least 200 artists in the city 
* Employ, directly or indirectly through procurement, at least 50 people in the city 
* Secure at least 2 skills partnerships (with business/HEIs and/or others) to develop a skills programme for young people in the city
* Increase media coverage of LEEDS 2023 by at least 10% 
* Increase digital audiences by at least 10%
