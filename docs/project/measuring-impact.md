    summary: A working document summarising the data needs for LEEDS 2023.
---

The team are taking a careful approach to ensuring that the impact of the LEEDS 2023 events is tracked and reported.
We are working with our evaluation partners to build the data framework which will collate, process and present the
impact. This will include baseline information about the socio-economic, cutural and tourism background to the region, as well as
specifically collected surveys which measure outputs.

As a starting point, we will pull together some of the economic targets drawn from baseline research and
analysis by BOP Consulting, using a variety of open data sources. We will then build on these to feed into
a framework for evaluating the reach, impact and performance of LEEDS 2023 and in the years ahead.

It is early days for this work, but we aim to start publishing these figures here in the coming months.

## Wireframe

The key visualisations from economic baseline research will be transferred onto the LEEDS 2023 Impact Dashboard in future, however for now we will be pulling together the visualisations roughly outlined below. The wireframe below was created on [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOWlUNu8=/?share_link_id=501874732910).

## Measuring the Impact of LEEDS 2023 on the Creative & Cultural Economy.

Our figures may differ slightly from those presented in the Economic Baseline report by BOP Consulting. This is likely because we used the industry/SIC code [classifications recommended by the Department for Culture Media & Sport](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203296/Classifying_and_Measuring_the_Creative_Industries_Consultation_Paper_April_2013-final.pdf), which may not match the categories used for analysis in the BOP report.

## The Creative & Cultural Industries are a significant employer in Leeds and West Yorkshire. 

### But we lag behind Manchester and Greater Manchester.

We will continue to develop on these visualisations over the coming weeks and months.
