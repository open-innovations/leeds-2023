<h2>Callout Responses</h2>

<p>
  The table below shows the number of responses received in response to each callout. These are ordered alphabetically rather than by date. The map shows
  the wards from which responses to all callouts are coming. Each hexagon represents a council ward in Leeds.
</p>

<p> 
  KEY: The hexagons that are darker in colour show wards with a higher number of entries.
