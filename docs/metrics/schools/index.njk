  title: LEEDS 2023 Metrics - Schools Engagement
  description: |
    Visualisations of key metrics related to engagement with young people.
limitations:
  - As identified above, there are a small number of schools which are not yet coded to a ward in the Airtable reference data we are using. This means there are a very small number of engagements not displayed in the hex map above
  - The percentage figures for number of schools engaged are slightly incaccurate. In part this is because of a small number of schools not yet coded to a ward, and in part as we explore how to best capture and display data related to through schools.
  - The true number of 'Number of Engagements' with young people are slightly lower than displayed. There are a few activities related to engagements with teachers that are currently being captured in the data we are using.
