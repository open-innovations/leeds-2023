# Data Release Process (DRAFT)

This process will be used prior to release of any new dataset or any significant new release of an existing dataset.

1. Extract data from operational systems and prepare for release
2. Review data against [release criteria](#data-release-criteria) with: Communications Team, Data Partner (Open Innovations), Business Owner
3. Create data release announcement and related communications material
4. Release data to Data Mill North and publish news story

## Data Release Criteria

Datasets may be released when the following criteria are met (operational and data governance concerns)

* No personal data is present in the dataset to be released
* No significant [re-identification risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_re-identification) in dataset
* The narrative of the dataset is understood by the team
* The dataset release does not coincide with other significant communication activity
