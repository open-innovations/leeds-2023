title: Workforce Diversity Data
summary: |
  Diversity is important to us. We're monitoring this internally
  using a standard developed right here in Leeds.
---

We're working to publish the Workforce Diversity for the LEEDS 2023 team as open data.
This will enable us to compare ourselves against the large organisations in Leeds that
publish to the [Open Innovations Diversity Dashboard][DASHBOARD].

It's early days for this project, so there's still quite a bit of work to do before we're
ready to share our data.
Our goal is to publish data about both the paid staff and volunteers every three months.

Once we've done this our workforce diversity figures will appear on the
[Diversity Dashboard][DASHBOARD].

This work builds on the [Diversity Dashboard Open Innovations project][OI-DIVERSITY-HUB]
which helped the Leeds Anchor Organisations publish and visualise their workforce diversity data.
We are leveraging this - by publishing a relatively small amount of our data,
we get a great benefit in transparency, discoverability and benchmarking.

The data will be published to [Data Mill North][DATAMILLNORTH].
