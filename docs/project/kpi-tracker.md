summary: We are automating the process of creating individual KPI reports for our stakeholders.
---

The LEEDS 2023 team have to periodically create KPI (Key Performance Indicator) reports for our stakeholders,
whether funders, trustees or other interested parties. This project is focussed on automating the process of
creating and presenting these reports, ideally with no manual processing.

These reports will be in a similar style to [Open Innovationsâ€™ sponsor reviews][OI_REVIEW], presenting the key
metrics and narrative that are important to each stakeholder. 

[OI_REVIEW]: https://open-innovations.org/services/sponsors/reports/2021/

We will start with Leeds City Council, the KPIs for which are as follows: 

* Create job opportunities for at least 200 artists in the city 
* Employ, directly or indirectly through procurement, at least 50 people in the city 
* Secure at least 2 skills partnerships (with business/HEIs and/or others) to develop a skills programme for young people in the city
* Increase media coverage of LEEDS 2023 by at least 10% 
* Increase digital audiences by at least 10% 

## Data

The table below shows each of the above KPIs, the data sources used to evaluate them and the current values reported by LEEDS 2023 as of March 2022. 

KPI | Data Source (TBC)
----|------------------

## Wireframe

The visualisation will be hosted on the LEEDS 2023 data microsite.

As a first iteration we will pull together the
above data sources into a short report to
represent performance against the 5 KPIs.
This may progress into a more sophisticated
visualisation in later iterations, but
for now it will look roughly as follows: 

<html>
<section class='outlined'>
{%- include "visualisations/kpi/lcc-report.njk" -%}
</section>
</html>

<section>
<h1>Examples of graphs</h1>

{% include "visualisations/kpi/example-graph.njk" %}

<style>
  table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
  }
  td, th {
    border: 1px solid lightgrey;
    padding: 0.4rem;
  }
  th {
    color: white;
    background: grey;
  }
  .outlined {
    border: 5rem solid grey;
    padding: 1rem 3rem;
  }
</style>
