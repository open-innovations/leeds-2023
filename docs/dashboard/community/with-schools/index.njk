title: Community Engagement (including schools)
work_in_progress: true
limitations:
  - Pupils cross ward boundaries to attend schools. As such, the number of school learners attending events held in schools should not be considered indicative of the number of learners who reside in a given ward attending events held in schools.
  - This page is a work in progress that will be extended as more data is aggregated onto this microsite. More activities have been held than are shown below, and more residents have been engaged. In addition, there have been many events organised by partners of LEEDS2023 and the wider community. We are currently not diplaying data about these.

  This dashboard shows Leedsâ€™ residents engagement with activities and events programmed by LEEDS 2023. 
  Bringing this data together in one place will give a quick view of wards where further engagement is needed.

<h2>Resident engagement (including school pupils)</h2>

<p>
  This section shows attendances by residents of Leeds at events and activities since May 2022. Each hexagon represents a council ward in 
  Leeds. The chart shows the distribution of attendees at LEEDS 2023 programmed activities.
</p>

<p>
  KEY: The hexagons that are darker in colour show areas with a higher number of attendees

      The metrics included in the overall hexmap are listed below. The data for each
      can be found in the table below the hexmap. The activity has been allocated to
      ward by mapping the postscodes associated with the activity. In the case of
      some metrics (e.g. school learners), this is the postcode of the school, not
      the residence postcode.
