title: Measuring the Impact of Leeds2023
---

As part of our work to help measure the impact of Leeds2023, we aim to visualise the current social and economic landscape of the region. This will allow us to compare how Leeds2023 has influenced perceptions of Leeds as a city of culture and an attractive visitor destination. 

As a starting point, we will pull together some of the economic targets drawn from baseline research and analysis by BOP Consulting, using a variety of open data sources. We will then build on these to feed into a framework for evaluating the reach, impact and performance of Leeds2023 and in the years ahead.

It is early days for this work, but we aim to start publishing these figures here in the coming months.
