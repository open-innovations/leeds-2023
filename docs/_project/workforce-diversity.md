title: Workforce Diversity Data
---

We're working on publishing the Workforce Diversity for the Leeds 2023 team as open data.
This will enable us to compare ourselves against the large organisations in Leeds that publish to the
[Open Innovations Diversity Dashboard](https://open-innovations.github.io/diversity-data/leeds-city-region/).

It's early days for this project, but we're planning to publish data about both the paid staff
and volunteers every three months.

Once we've done this our workforce diversity figures will appear on the Leeds Diversity Dashboard.
